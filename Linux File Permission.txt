Security is the key in the mordern computing world
so in linux there are 2 level of security is called 
authorisation levels

user amos
$sudo adduser amos

 company
	->management
		->CEO
		-->user1
          --->user2
	->production
	->sales
	->finanace
	->IT
	->visitors


create groups :

$ sudo addgroup <grpname>

->management
->finanace
->
->IT
-> Visitor





1) Ownership
------------

=>user
 	Usually User is the owner of a file
=>group
	usergroup contain multiple users
	all users in one group have sthe same permission in the group
$addgroup <GrpName>
$sudo !!


/etc/group --- group onfo is stored in here

$ less /etc/group


=> Other
	Any other user who has access to a file
	Does not own the file
	Does not belong to a user group

Changing Ownership of a file/Dorectory

$ chown <user> <filename>

$ chown <user>:<group> <filename>

eg: chown  :sales user1
eg:chown amos:sales user1



2) Permissions
----------------

=>read
	read permission will provide permission to read.

=>write
	Write permissions will provide permission to write and edit 
	Write permission to a directory will allow a user to create, delete 
	and modify a file in that directory.

=>Execute
	In Windows normally executable files will have "exe" extension. 
	that is called executable file 

	r read permission
	w write file
	x execute permission


Changing file/directory permissions
=====================================

=> chmod permission <file/Directory name>
 ->using changemode (chmod) command we can assign permissions on a file

There are 2 ways we can assign a permission

1)Absolute (Numeric) mode 
2) Symbolic mode 


File Type
 |
 |user   group  Others
 -r w x  r w x  r w x	---------Symbolic mode
  | | |  | | |  | | |
  | | |  | | |  | | |
  4 2 1  4 2 1  4 2 1  } Absolute/Numeric mode
  \ | /  \ | /  \ | /
    7      7      7

user r+w+x (7) group r+x(5) others r+x(5)
chmod 755 <filename>
chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx <Filename>

 

Number	Permission  	Symbol
========================================

0		no permission	  _
1		Execute		  --x
2		Wrirte		  -w-
3		Exicute+Write 	  -wx
4		Read			  r--
5		Read + Execute	  r-x
6		Read + Write	  rw-
7 	 Read + Write + Execute	  rwx


Summary:

 ->Linux being a multi-user system uses permissions and ownership for security.
   
 ->There are three user types on a Linux system User, Group and Other
   
 ->Linux divides the file permissions into read, write and execute denoted by r,w, and x
    
 ->The permissions on a file can be changed by ‘chmod’ command which can be further divided into Absolute and Symbolic mode
    
 ->The ‘chown’ command can change the ownership of a file/directory. Use the following commands: chown user file or chown user:group file

->The ‘chgrp’ command can change the group ownership chrgrp group filename
  
 ->What does x – eXecuting a directory mean? A: Being allowed to “enter” a dir and gain possible access to sub-dirs.
