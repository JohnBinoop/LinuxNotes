This is a Note for the Linux system boot process by Binoop


->After a computer starts the bios on the mother board checks all the I/O devices in the computer.
->Once everything is okay then the Boot process will began.
->The Boor program usually is on boot sector of the first hard drive.
-> in mordern linux computer that boot loader is GRUB(Grand Unified Boot loader ) 
->then it look in the hard disk for the bootable files 
-> and start load the Linux Kernel
->then Linux Kernel load  the inistial RAM disk which contain bunch of device driver 
-> then look for the device drivers in the hard drive then load, eventually mount the filesystem
->all setup and ready to go
-> Kernel's main focus on the process of input that it was given then intract with the hardware.
->Linux system will do many things, but we needed to load lots of program innorder to use the computer
-> to perform that we need a program genarally called servicess or demon
-> Then initialisation starts once initialisatio starts its takes over mounting the file system
->At this Point initial RAM disk nolonger needed then gets removed 
->Then initialisation system continously load then service get loaded to get the computer can be used
->Boots Logs:
	->Logs are genarated when computer gets boots up
	->These logs are volatile that means thease logs are typically removed when computer gets rebooted
	-> This Logs are located in Kernel's ring buffers,ring buffer is datastructure that record the messages are related to the kerneloperations
	-> which can be controlled or examin by the command called "dmesg" or journalctl -k

	-> the ringbuffer has a fixed size so it will be deleted older messaged when it gets full.
